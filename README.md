# Project Outline

**Empowering the Nation**, founded by Precious Radebe in 2018, has a mission to provide training to develop skills for domestic workers and gardeners, helping them become more valuable, enabling higher income, and empowering them to start their own small businesses.

The goals of the **Empowering the Nation** project were to:

1. Develop a webpage to advertise the business and showcase the services offered. The webpage would provide information about the training programs, the materials they cover, and include a way for users to request information about courses or other services.

2. Develop a mobile app with the same functionality as the webpage, allowing mobile access to services, program information, and course requests. This ensures an intuitive and user-friendly interface from the start.
